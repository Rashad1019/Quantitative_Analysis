**A professional quantitative finance project analyzing Risk vs. Return for MSFT, GBTC, TSLA, and NVDA.**

---

## 📄 Project Overview

This project demonstrates proficiency in **quantitative finance** and **data science** by applying rigorous statistical techniques to historical stock data. Moving beyond subjective investing, this analysis uses mathematical models to evaluate four distinct equities over a one-year period (Nov 2024 – Nov 2025).

**The Goal:** To determine the optimal investment choice by balancing **Volatility (Risk)** against **Annualized Returns**.

### 🎯 Objectives
*   **Data Engineering:** Robust collection and cleaning of financial time-series data.
*   **Statistical Analysis:** Calculation of daily returns, standard deviation, and correlation matrices.
*   **Risk Assessment:** Evaluation of volatility and Sharpe Ratios to measure risk-adjusted performance.
*   **Visualization:** Creation of interactive, professional charts using Plotly.

## 📊 Key Findings & Recommendation

After a comprehensive analysis of Volatility, Correlation, and Risk-Adjusted Returns:

### 🏆 **Final Recommendation: Microsoft (MSFT)**

*   **Why?** MSFT achieved the highest **Sharpe Ratio (0.801)**, indicating it delivered the best returns relative to the risk taken.
*   **Risk Profile:** It demonstrated the lowest annualized volatility (24.23%), making it the most stable asset in the portfolio.
*   **Performance:** Delivered a strong +22.38% total return without the extreme drawdowns seen in other tickers.

| Ticker | Total Return | Annualized Volatility | Sharpe Ratio | Verdict |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **MSFT** | **+22.38%** | **24.23%** | **0.801** | ✅ **Strong Buy** |
| **NVDA** | +26.97% | 49.90% | 0.656 | ⚠️ High Volatility |
| **TSLA** | +18.18% | 65.55% | 0.523 | ❌ Excessive Risk |
| **GBTC** | -2.36% | 43.19% | 0.067 | ❌ Underperform |
